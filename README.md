1. Create a function that converts the image into grayscale by calculating luminance (consider Y = 0.3R + 0.59G + 0.11B) [100 XP]

2. Create a function that changes the image's contrast according to a given parameter [100 XP]

3. Calculate the image's Histogram and draw it [100 XP]

4. Create a function that segments the image using global thresholding [100 XP]

5. Implement other visual effects. Do not forget to be creative! [100 XP]
